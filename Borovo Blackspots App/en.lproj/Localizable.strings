It is part of an integrated information system for street safety measures under the project \"W-TEN - Well connected nodes Giurgiu-Borovo to TEN-T transport network\", funded by the program \"INTERREG V-A ROMANIA-BULGARIA\" and national co-financing.
Its purpose is to provide useful information about the historical accumulation of road accidents on municipal roads that over time have formed locations (zones) that are particularly dangerous and for which the application alerts users when approaching.
Using it, you can report a new road accident if you witness one, with just a few clicks. You should keep in mind that this reporting does not replace calling 112, so it is important to remember that you must first call 112 and then, if you wish, submit information about the accident through this application.";

The project aims to improve and restore the transport and operational qualities of the street network in Borovo, which provides connectivity of the town with first class road I-5, which is an important transport artery and section of European transport corridor № 9.

The location of the municipality from a geographical point of view is strategic and determines its place in the national transport, energy and communication infrastructure. The first-class road I-5 /Ruse-Veliko Tarnovo-Podkova/ passes through the territory of the municipality and is a part of the European transport corridor № 9. It allows for fast transportation of passengers and goods to the regional center - Ruse /within 30-40 minutes/, Byala /10-15 minutes/, Veliko Tarnovo /50-60 minutes/ and many other destinations.

It is a royal ritual silver set with gilding, consisting of five vessels - three rhytons with a protome of a bull, a horse and a sphinx, a jug and a bowl.
According to Georgi Kitov, the Borovo treasure can be defined in the most definite way as a Thracian monument, which combines animal and human images and illustrates the path of stylistic and plot development from geometry to realism.";

It is covered with a semi-cylindrical vault, the front facade is to the east. The entrance has a trapezoidal shape, the door closes the entrance by sliding in grooves.

The inhabitants of the village have won the right to build a church, and the former Bulgarian cemetery was chosen as the place of construction. The preparation and construction of the church lasted from 1867 to 1870. It was officially opened in 1871.";
